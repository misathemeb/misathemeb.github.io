## Project Status

Project is:  _complete_ but always making small tweaks

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:

* Launch featured projects from grid clicks as links OR
* Create slide out image preview of featured project
* Consider using Less to refator CSS
* Consider using React or Angular

To do:

* Organize code into more modular stylesheets for readability
* Create a backend using a lightweight node.js app like Express
* Use get/set methods and local storage to maintain user preference for light or dark mode across pages
