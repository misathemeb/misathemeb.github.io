Hello! I made this little review site using html/CSS/JS. Free stock images for user photos from https://pixabay.com/ and the https://party.js.org/ library to brighten up the surprise button functionality.

The site was first created with hard coded text to practice event listening code. The next iteration 2.0 was created using AJAX GET for the text from a file.
