👋 Hi, I’m @misathemeb! I am a research scientist by trade and am new to coding. I have no prior knowledge of coding or formal programming up until this moment in time (Autumn 2021). 

👀 I’m interested in becoming a front end developer.

🌱 I’m currently learning html/css/js/python.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code review and/or potential career opportunities. I'm excellent with project mgmt and clinical research objectives.

📫 How to reach me @misathemeb on @twitter @instagram

I am using Codecademy Pro as my primary learning platform and would like to share some projects as I am introduced to new concepts. The projects I will be posting are up for code review and feedback.
For now, I will be posting HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Python projects.
Note: Each language will be specified on a corresponding file title suffix.
