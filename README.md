Hi, I am a research scientist by trade and am new to coding. I have no prior knowledge of coding or formal programming up until this moment in time (Autumn 2021). 

I am using Codecademy Pro as my learning platform and would like to share some projects as I am introduced to new concepts. The projects I will be posting are up for code review and feedback.
For now, I will be posting HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Python projects.

Note: Each language will be specified on a corresponding repository title suffix.
