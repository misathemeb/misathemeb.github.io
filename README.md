👋 Hi, I’m @misathemeb! I am a research scientist by trade and am new to coding. I have no prior knowledge of coding or formal programming up until this moment in time (Autumn 2021). 

👀 I’m interested in becoming a front end developer.

🌱 I’m currently passionate about html/CSS/JavaScript/Python3. Also a huge fan of international travel and music. d(^_^)b

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code review and/or potential career opportunities. I'm excellent with project mgmt and clinical research objectives.

📫 How to reach me: @misathemeb on @twitter @instagram

I am using Codecademy Pro front-end career path as a learning platform (along with a multitude of internet resources) to continue my learning. I make things as I'm introduced to the concepts and post about them here. Please feel free to code review and/or provide feedback to improve.
